# Me

I'm Sahil, at the time of writing I am 17 years old and live in England.

### Passions
My biggest passion is simply being at the vanguard of human development in some shape or form.
My dream is to run companies with trillion dollar valuation that genuinely change the world 
for the better.

There are a lot of things I enjoy doing and would love to imagine I'm good at, 
but my main interests at the moment are:

- Philosophy
- Entrepreneurship
- Programming and CS in general
- Science and math (Mainly Physics pushed to its extremely)
- - (and no, I don't count biology as a science, idc that it fits the definition, biology sucks)
- Chess
- FS Wrestling and Powerlifting
- Reading


# This Site

After watching The Social Network (2010) and seeing Zuccy post his blogs while programming I got inspired
 to make my own, and asked my friend Ash (If I haven't made that into a hyperlink yet please remind me to do so)
 for help and here we are.

I'm going to use this site to share any ideas I have on any of my areas of interest, 
in the hopes of entertaining or maybe even helping someone such as yourself.
Anything I say is just my opinion and be treated as such (yes, despite the fact that my opinions are objectively correct all of the time)
